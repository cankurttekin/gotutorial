six main points:
1. statically typed language
declare types explicitly or inferred
2. strongly typed language
cannot mix types a=1 b="two" => X c=a+b
3. compiled language
4. fast compile time
5. built in concurrency
goroutines
6. simplicity
garbage collection etc


structure of go code:
modules and packages
package is folder that contains collection of go files.
collection of these packages called module.
when init. a new project init. a module.
