generics
lets say we have funcs that sums up the vals of an integer slice
also float32 slice
 ( sumIntSlice, sumFloat32Slice, sumFloat64Slice....)

to not to repeat code like this we use generics in golang

we can think of generics as way of allowing func to receive additional params except instead of a value we are passing in a type
